## WTF? 

This is an extremely experimental PureScript embedding of [SnarkyJS](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/tree/main). Its official purpose is a proof-of-concept for a DSL in support of the MLabs [zkPal](https://zkignite.minaprotocol.com/zkignite/dev4dev/draftproposals/suggestion/569) zkIgnite proposal. Its unofficial purpose is facilitate learning about SnarkyJS/zkCircuits and to do some fun things with types :)

If you're from zkIgnite, please note that this is a research project intended to demonstrate the viability of the concept of a circuit DSL. It does not represent the final design. Though we are rather fond of Purescript, we do not want to force people to learn the language if we can avoid it. 

## How to use 

Documentation forthcoming. See `Main.purs` for a working example.
